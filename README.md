A webhook platform to get files from an analytical platform.
The project is about handling the results data of the analytical platforms and handing them over to the users.
When an analysis is done by an analytical platform using a certain dataset, the user will be notified through an email informing that the 
-analysis processing has been finished. 
Thereafter the user has to download the results of the analysis using the link provided in the email. 
But when the user fails to collect the results within a certain period, the input dataset as well as the results data will be erased from 
-the analytical platform. 
Thus, a platform has to be developed so as to receive the results data from analytic platforms, hold them and send them to the user. 
The Webhook platform will be providing the solution for this. It will make sure that the user will receive the results data without loss.
